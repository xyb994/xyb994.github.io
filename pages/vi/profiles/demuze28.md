## Hello Everyone!!!

My name is **Daniel Munoz** but I usually go by Danny 😄. I am from New York (*Time zone: Eastern Standard Time*) and I am using MAC OS High Sierra Version 10.13.16 

I am a Business Administration major with a minor in Computer Science and Mathematics at State University of New York at Oswego 📔 ✏️.

[SUNY Oswego](http://oswego.edu)

I have taken Software engineering courses as well as courses in various programming languages ranging from Java to Clojure. My goal is to become a software engineer when I graduate. 

In my free time I design websites for friends and colleagues and I love to go hiking with my dog Silver! I am excited to begin this internship and meet my new team!
