## About Me    

I am currently a senior in college, pursuing my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I will be graduating in May 2019.  
I am passionate about software development. Web Development, in particular, really stands out to me. I find it to be more  
intuitive and enjoyable. It is one of the few careers where you can combine logic and creativity. And that is mainly what  
drew me towards this career choice.  

### Languages, Frameworks, and Libraries That I Am Familiar With: 
``C++, C#.NET, Python, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, MongoDB``
