## About

![autonomous-car](https://portfolio.proqweb.com/img/auto-car.jpg "picture of self driving car, controlled using an Arduino board")

I am a graduate from **Arizona State University**. I majored in **Computer Systems Engineering** and graduated with a Bachelors of Science in Engineering.

Taking an _Embedded Microprocessors_ course was my favorite part about my college experience, because I was able to work with Arduino boards and really learn a lot about being an engineer. I truly enjoyed the creatve projects given to us and loved being able to use code to make things happen.

More recenty, I'm an aspiring Web Developer and have worked with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL. 
I hope to develop my skills and confidence to start developing web applications and doing more profitable freelance work.
