### About Me ###
I currently work at Universal Studios Orlando as a wardrobe attendant but is looking to change to a career in STEM. What I know comes from a combination of websites such as Udacity, codecademy and free code camp, and meeting local devs at various events within my community. I am eager to improve my current skills as well as learn new ones. I also take delight in outdoors activities and enjoy graphic art as a hobby. 

### Languages ###
HTML, CSS, Javascript, Java, Android Studio
